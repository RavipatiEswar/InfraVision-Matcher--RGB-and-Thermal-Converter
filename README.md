The images are made to match clearly one upon other exactly .
which helps in finding differences and also image analyzer and match finder .
img_T refers Thermal
img_Z refers Real
#for execution
whenever you run the cell it shows to upload images of thremal and general image given .
Here Thermal image is uneven and doesnot sink to the original perfectly .
So after making the adjustments using the python modules and codes then 
the imazge is resized and settled to save in the output folders where i have attached the img_T, img_Z then the altered image is saved in the output folders as img_AT.
